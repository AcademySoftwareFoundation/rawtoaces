## Introduction
The RAW to ACES Utility or `rawtoaces`, is a software package that converts digital camera RAW file to ACES container files containing image data encoded according the the Academy Color Encoding Specification (ACES) as specified in SMPTE 2065-1.  This is accomplished through one of two methods.

1. CameraRAW RGB data (generated by libraw) is converted to ACES by calculating an Input Device Transform (IDT) based on the camera's sensitivity and a light source.

2. CameraRAW RGB data (generated by libraw) is converted to ACES by calculating and RGB to XYZ matrix using information included in `libraw` and metadata found in the RAW file.



The output image complies with the ACES Container specification (*SMPTE S2065-4*).

## Package Contents

The source code contains the following:

* [`cmake/`](./cmake) - CMake modules for locating dependencies (e.g.,  `libraw `)
* [`config/`](./config) - CMake configuration files
* [`data/`](./data) - Data files containing camera sensitivity, light source, color matching function and 190 training patch data
* [`lib/`](./lib) - IDT and math libraries
* [`main.cpp`](main.cpp), [`rawtoaces.h`](rawtoaces.h) - C++ source code files for call routines to process images
* [`usage.h`](usage.h) - C++ header files containing `rawtoaces` usage information


## Prerequisites

###### CMake

CMake can be downloaded directly from [https://cmake.org/]() and/or installed using one of the commands below.

* Ubuntu

	```sh
	$ sudo apt-get install cmake
	```

* Redhat

	```sh
	$ yum install cmake
	```

* OS X

	Install homebrew if not already installed
	
	```sh
	$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
	```
	
	Install cmake
	
	```sh
	$ brew install cmake
	```

###### IlmBase

The rawtoaces depends on an essential part of IlmBase software package, which can be downloaded from [http://www.openexr.com]() and/or installed using one of the commands below.

* Ubuntu

	```sh
	$ sudo apt-get install libilmbase-dev
	```

* Redhat

	```sh
	$ yum install ilmbase-devel
	```

* OS X

	Install homebrew if not already installed
	
	```sh
	$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
	```
	
	Install ilmBase
	
	```sh
	$ brew install ilmBase
	```

###### OpenEXR

As the outcome is in the OpenEXR image file format, you should download OpenEXR. OpenEXR can be downloaded from [http://www.openexr.com/downloads.html]() and/or installed using one of the commands below.

* Ubuntu

	```sh
	$ sudo apt-get install libopenexr-dev
	```

* Redhat

	```sh
	$ yum install OpenEXR-devel
	```

* OS X

	Install homebrew if not already installed
	
	```sh
	$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
	```
	
	Install OpenEXR
	
	```sh
	$ brew install openexr
	```
	
###### ACES Container 

ACES Container is the reference implementation for a file writer intended to be used with the Academy Color Encoding System (ACES). `rawtoaces` relies on it to produce images that comply with the ACES container specification (SMPTE S2065-4). LibRaw can be downloaded from [https://github.com/ampas/aces_container]() or installed using one of the commands below.

* Ubuntu / Redhat / OS X

__NOTE : During the beta period please use the build of ACES container specified below__
	
	Install aces-container
	
	```sh
	git clone git@github.com:miaoqi/aces_container.git
	git checkout windowBuildSupport

	mkdir build && cd build
	cmake ..
	make
	sudo make install	
	```

###### LibRaw

LibRaw is the library that obtains RAW files from digital cameras. It handles image pre-processing for rawtoaces. LibRaw can be downloaded from [http://www.libraw.org/download]() or installed using one of the commands below.

* Ubuntu

	```sh
	$ sudo apt-get install libraw-dev
	```

* Redhat

	```sh
	$ yum install libraw1394-devel
	```

* OS X

	Install homebrew if not already installed
	
	```sh
	$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
	```
	
	Install OpenEXR
	
	```sh
	$ brew install libraw
	```
	
###### Ceres Solver

Ceres Solver is an open source library for solving Non-linear Least Squares problems with bounds constraints and unconstrained optimization problems. It processes non-linear regression for rawtoaces. Ceres Solver can be downloaded from [http://ceres-solver.org/]() or installed using one of the commands below.

* Linux (e.g. Ubuntu)

	Install `google-glog + gflags`
	
	``` sh
	sudo apt-get install libgoogle-glog-dev
	```
	
	Install `BLAS & LAPACK`
	
	``` sh
	sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev
	```
	
	Install `Eigen3`

	``` sh
	sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev
	```
	
   Install `SuiteSparse and CXSparse` (*optional*)
   
   	``` sh
	sudo apt-get install libsuitesparse-dev
	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bzindovic/suitesparse-bugfix-1319687
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install libsuitesparse-dev
	```

	
   Build, Test and Install `Ceres`
	
	``` sh
	tar zxf ceres-solver-version#.tar.gz
	mkdir ceres-bin
	cd ceres-bin
	cmake ../ceres-solver-version#
	make -j3
	make test
	sudo make install
	```

* OS X

	Install homebrew if not already installed
	
	```sh
	$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
	```
	
	Install `Ceres`
	
	```sh
	$ brew install ceres-solver --HEAD
	```
If there are errors with regard to version mis-match of *Eigen* library, please consider brew-installing required libraries first and then buiding Ceres from source (see above).

## Installation

* OS X

	Install homebrew if not already installed

	```sh
	$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
	```

	Install rawtoaces

	```sh
	$ (coming soon ...)
	```

*  From Source

	From the root source directory:

	```sh
	$ mkdir build && cd build
	$ cmake ..
	$ make
	$ sudo make install
	```

	The default process will install `librawtoacesIDT.dylib` to `/usr/local/lib`, a few header files to `/usr/local/include/RAWTOACES` and a number of data files into `/usr/local/include/RAWTOACES`
