## Introduction
The RAW to ACES Utility or `rawtoaces`, is a software package that converts digital camera RAW file to ACES container files containing image data encoded according the the Academy Color Encoding Specification (ACES) as specified in SMPTE 2065-1.  This is accomplished through one of two methods.

1. CameraRAW RGB data (generated by libraw) is converted to ACES by calculating an Input Device Transform (IDT) based on the camera's sensitivity and a light source.

2. CameraRAW RGB data (generated by libraw) is converted to ACES by calculating and RGB to XYZ matrix using information included in `libraw` and metadata found in the RAW file.

The output image complies with the ACES Container specification (*SMPTE S2065-4*).

## Package Contents

The source code contains the following:

* [`cmake/`](./cmake) - CMake modules for locating dependencies (e.g.,  `libraw `)
* [`config/`](./config) - CMake configuration files
* [`data/`](./data) - Data files containing camera sensitivity, light source, color matching function and 190 training patch data
* [`lib/`](./lib) - IDT and math libraries
* [`main.cpp`](main.cpp), [`rawtoaces.h`](rawtoaces.h) - C++ source code files for call routines to process images

If there are errors with regard to version mis-match of *Eigen* library, please consider brew-installing required libraries first and then buiding Ceres from source (see above).

## Installation

* OS X

	Install homebrew if not already installed

	```sh
	$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
	```

	Install rawtoaces

	```

*  From Source

	From the root source directory:

	```sh
	$ mkdir build && cd build
	$ cmake ..
	$ make
	$ sudo make install
	```

	The default process will install `librawtoacesIDT.dylib` to `/usr/local/lib`, a few header files to `/usr/local/include/RAWTOACES` and a number of data files into `/usr/local/include/RAWTOACES`
	
## Usage

### Overview

`rawtoaces` uses one of three methods to convert RAW image files to ACES.

1. Camera spectral sensitivities and illuminant spectral power distributions
2. Camera file metadata
3. Camera data included in the `libraw` software

The preferred, and most accurate, method of converting RAW image files to ACES is to use camera spectral sensitivities and illuminant spectral power distributions, if available.  If spectral sensitivity data is available for the camera, `rawtoaces` uses the method described in Academy document [P-2013-001](http://j.mp/P-2013-001).

While preferred, camera spectral sensitivity data is not commonly known by a general user. When that is the case, `rawtoaces` can use either the metadata embedded in the camera file or camera data included in `libraw` to approximate a conversion to ACES.

### RAW conversion options

In most cases the default values for all "RAW conversion options" should be sufficient.  Please see the help menu for details of the RAW conversion options.

### Conversion using spectral sensitivities

If spectral sensitivity data for your camera is included with `rawtoaces` then the following command will convert your RAW file to ACES using that information.

	$ rawtoaces input.raw
	
This command is equivalent to :
	
	$ rawtoaces --wb-method 0 --mat-method 0 input.raw
	
This is the preferred method as camera white balance gain factors and the RGB to ACES conversion matrix will be calculated using the spectral sensitivity data from your camera. This provides the most accurate conversion to ACES. 

By default, `rawtoaces` will determine the adopted white by finding the set of white balance gain factors calculated from spectral sensitivities closest to the "As Shot" (aka Camera Multiplier) white balance gain factors included in the RAW file metadata.  This default behavior can be overridden by including the desired adopted white name after white balance method.  The following example will use the white balance gain factors calculated from spectral sensitivities for D55. 

	$ rawtoaces --wb-method 0 D55 --mat-method 0 input.raw

If you have spectral sensitivity data for your camera but it is not included with `rawtoaces` you may place that data in `/usr/local/include/RAWTOACES/data/camera` or use the `--ss-path` option to point `rawtoaces` to the path of data.

An example of the use of the --ss-path option would be 

	$ rawtoaces --ss-path /path/to/my/ss/data/ input.raw

#### Camera spectral sensitivity data format

Include basic information on the data format here

### Conversion using camera file metadata

In lieu of spectral sensitivity data, camera metadata can be used to convert RAW files to ACES.  This includes the camera multiplier white balance gains and any RGB to XYZ matrix included.  The RGB to XYZ matrix included in metadata will be used to calculate the final RGB to ACES matrix used for conversion.  The accuracy of this method is dependent on the camera manufacturer building writing correct metadata into their RAW files.

The following commands will convert RAW to ACES using the camera file metadata for both white balance and the RGB to XYZ matrix.

	$ rawtoaces --wb-method 1 --mat-method 1 input.raw
	
### Conversion using camera data included in libraw

`libraw` includes matrices for a wide range of cameras which may provide a reasonable basis for conversion from RGB to ACES.  These matrices were calculated by Adobe and are often referred to as the Adobe coefficients. To use these built in matrices the following command may be used.

	$ rawtoaces --mat-method 2
	
`libraw` also provides a few other methods for calculating white balance, including averaging the entire image, averaging a specified box within the image, or explicitly specifying the white balance gain factors to be used.  These options can be utilized by using `--wb-method [2-4]` as desired.
